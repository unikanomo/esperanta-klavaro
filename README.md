Esporanto keyboard for windows

This is a keyboard layout, for windows, to enable the easy typing of the Esperanto letters with circumflexs 
ie ĉ ĝ ĥ ĵ ŝ ŭ by holding the AltGr (right alt) button and at the same time as pressing the equivalent letter without a circumflex ie c g h j s u

it is based on the GB keyborad layout, so people using a US keyboard layout or other layout, may find some things are in a differant place eg @

To install, downlaod the zipfile, extract the archive to a folder, then use the setup.exe file in the “eogbkeys” folder to install

Alternatively you can build your own install file from the .klc file using Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4

When you have installed the keyboard you will need to make it available to use, in windows 10* you can do this by using the “add a language” option in the “region & language section” found in the “time & language” section of the settings.
Use this to add esperanto as a lauguage, then use the options button to add the esperanto keyboard to this

when you have done this you should see an option in the taskbar to switch between languages



*in windows 7 and 8 there will be a similar option in the control panel
